## Important

You will need to provide your own Google Maps API Key or your own Mapbox tokens so that the plugin can work properly.

To know how to generate your Google API Key and your Mapbox tokens please follow the steps described in these guides:

* [How to generate a Google Maps API Key](https://github.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator/wiki/How-to-generate-a-Google-Maps-key)

* [How to get your Mapbox tokens](https://github.com/eddiesigner/sketch-map-generator/wiki/How-to-get-your-Mapbox-tokens)

**If you already use this plugin please backup your Google API Key, Mapbox tokens and map settings. The plugin will try to use the data you have saved but if something unexpected happens, it is better to have that data at hand.**
